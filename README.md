# Recerca Cerdanya Talk

A talk I gave at Museu Cerd√† about game feel, this is the source code of the project, you can see the PDF presentation [here](https://gerardgascon.com/talks/art_programacio.pdf).

## How it works

The idea that makes this presentation work is that inside PowerPoint a Visual Basic script launches the unity game with a command line argument.
This argument is the same number as the one that is present in some slides, this corresponds to the same scene inside the unity project.
